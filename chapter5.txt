Alice's Side Story: The Enchanted Stream
One warm summer day, long before Alice discovered the old map in her grandmother's attic, she loved to explore the picturesque surroundings of Meadowbrook. One of her favorite places was a small, crystal-clear stream that meandered through the Whispering Woods. The stream was said to have magical properties, and the village children often whispered tales of its enchanted waters.

On this particular day, Alice decided to venture deeper along the stream than she had ever gone before. She packed a small picnic and set off, humming a cheerful tune. The sunlight filtered through the trees, creating dappled patterns on the forest floor, and the sound of the babbling stream was soothing.

As she walked, Alice noticed a glimmer in the water. Curiosity piqued, she knelt by the stream and reached into the cool water, pulling out a beautiful, intricately carved stone. The stone was unlike anything she had ever seen, with delicate engravings that seemed to shimmer in the light.

As she examined the stone, she felt a strange, comforting warmth emanate from it. Alice decided to follow the stream further, wondering if there might be more to discover. After a while, she came upon a hidden glade where the stream pooled into a small, serene pond. In the center of the pond stood a grand oak tree with roots that stretched into the water, creating a natural bridge.

Curiosity led Alice across the bridge, and as she reached the other side, she found a small, ornate box nestled among the tree's roots. Inside the box were tiny, luminous stones that glowed softly. As she touched one, a gentle voice filled her mind, explaining that these were wish stones, each holding a single wish for those pure of heart.

Excited yet respectful of the magic, Alice made a simple wish: that she would always have the courage and wisdom to face whatever challenges came her way. The stone glowed brightly before fading back to its original state. Alice carefully placed the stone back in the box, feeling a deep sense of connection to the enchanted stream and its hidden magic.

Years later, as she embarked on her adventure to find the treasure in the Whispering Woods, Alice often recalled her discovery by the stream. She realized that her wish for courage and wisdom had already begun to shape her journey, guiding her through the challenges and mysteries that lay ahead.
